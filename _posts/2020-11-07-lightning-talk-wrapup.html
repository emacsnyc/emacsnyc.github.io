<p>On November 2nd, 2020, we had a series of lightning talks by members of the community.</p>

<h3>Raymond Puzio --- emacs hypernotebooks</h3>
<p>Raymond presented his notebook software that uses Emacs to bring together multiple programs to make a single set of computations. It's able to pass data back and forth between these programs, generate results, and even output publication-quality documents. Raymond referenced a previous EmacsNYC talk Evan Misshula gave about reproducible research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y. Raymond will be publishing his code soon.</p>
<h3>Adrien Brochard -- emacs user survey 2020</h3>
<p>Adrien spoke about his user survey, aimed at finding out how the community uses Emacs. You can find more information and fill it out at https://emacssurvey.org/.</p>
<h3>Qiantan Hong -- crdt.el, a collaborative environment</h3>
<p>Quintan spoke about crdt.el, a project which enables collaboration through shared editing sessions. Check it out here: https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el. This project uses algorithms from the Conflict-free Replicated Data Types family. A talk about this can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw</p>
<h3>Qiantan Hong -- reflexive-music, an experimental music environment with Emacs as frontend</h3>
<p>Quintan presented reflexive-music, an environment to create music through code. He ended his presentation with a live concert. He was inspired by Ivan Wyshnegradsky, a Russian composer known for his microtonal compositions. Contact Quintan to encourage him to publish his code!</p>
<h3>Zachary Kanfer -- Composing Electronic Music in Emacs</h3>
<p>Zachary presented his solution to boredom during quarantine: his software to compose looping music in Emacs. He had to dive into WAVE files to create it. Find it at https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zmusic/.</p>
