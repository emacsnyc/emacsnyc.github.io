<p>On December 7th, 2020, we had a talk by <a href="https://www.josh.agency/">Josh Holbrook</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Org mode, the task management and document markup system for Emacs, includes a tool called Babel which may be used for literate programming. In this talk I will explain literate programming, discuss how Org mode and Babel enable it, and go over an example using the slide deck itself. I will also cover some real-world experiences writing literate programs in Emacs and the pros and cons of doing so.</blockquote></p>

<p>Josh has made his <a href="https://github.com/jfhbrook/public-gpl/blob/main/talks/literate-programming-2020/talk.pdf">slides</a> available, as well as their <a href="https://github.com/jfhbrook/public-gpl/tree/main/talks/literate-programming-2020">source</a>.</p>
