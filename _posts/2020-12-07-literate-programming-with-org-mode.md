On December 7th, 2020, we had a talk by [Josh
Holbrook](https://www.josh.agency)

> Org mode, the task management and document markup system for Emacs,
> includes a tool called Babel which may be used for literate
> programming. In this talk I will explain literate programming,
> discuss how Org mode and Babel enable it, and go over an example
> using the slide deck itself. I will also cover some real-world
> experiences writing literate programs in Emacs and the pros and cons
> of doing so.
