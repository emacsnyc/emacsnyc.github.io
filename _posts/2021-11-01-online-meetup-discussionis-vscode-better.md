Vi is old news and the new game in town VSCode. It's taking everyone
by storm! Stand down Sublime Text! Did anyone even use Atom? Good bye,
PyCharm, GoLand, or other JetBrains editors! You've all been replaced
by an editor that implements the Language Server Protocol and is
developed by Microsoft. I hear they <3 open source.

Is VSCode all that it's cracked up to be? Should we be concerned that
this means we'll lose good development on Emacs?

Join us as we discuss why VSCode is better! Or is it?
