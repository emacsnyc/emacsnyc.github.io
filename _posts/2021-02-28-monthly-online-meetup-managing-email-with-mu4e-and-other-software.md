Managing Email with mu4e and Other Software

A talk by Eric Collins, Founder/Organizer of EmacsNYC and Senior
Engineer/Engineering Manager at Parachute Health.

You really enjoy doing everything in Emacs, editing text, managing all
of your tasks, playing games like 2048, or building presentations, but
do you read your email there? There are lots of options to choose
from, but we'll focus on setting up mu4e for seamless indexing and
reading. This will include setting up supporting software that makes
this all work together seamlessly to process your email.

Bringing email into familiar keybindings dramatically improves your
ability to read and process messages. It's so helpful, you might just
very well be able to achieve inbox zero.
