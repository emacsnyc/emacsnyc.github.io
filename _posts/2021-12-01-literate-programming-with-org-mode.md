A talk by Josh Holbrook

> Org mode, the task management and document markup system for Emacs,
> includes a tool called Babel which may be used for literate
> programming. In this talk I will explain literate programming, discuss
> how Org mode and Babel enable it, and go over an example using the
> slide deck itself. I will also cover some real-world experiences
> writing literate programs in Emacs and the pros and cons of doing so.
