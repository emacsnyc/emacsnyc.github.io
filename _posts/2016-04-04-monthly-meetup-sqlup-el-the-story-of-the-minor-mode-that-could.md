We're starting at 6:30pm, as always we will have pizza and beer!

Aldric [website][github] will be giving a talk about creating sqlup, creating minor modes and distributing them.

> This talk will take you through the creation of a minor mode. It will
> cover the fundamentals of the creation of a minor mode with all its
> options and examples of how to use them, then take you through how
> I've approached the creation of sqlup.el and some of the choices I've
> made.
