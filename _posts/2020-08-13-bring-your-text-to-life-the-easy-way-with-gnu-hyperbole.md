A talk by the author, Bob Weiner

> Like Emacs itself, GNU Hyperbole is an integrated, extensible,
> self-documenting, and programmable hypertextual editing environment
> delivered as a single ELPA package for quick installation and
> evaluation. But where to start with such a large package?
>
> This talk will provide a detailed, interactive overview of GNU
> Hyperbole's major capabilities and how they can speed knowledge
> work, including:
>
> 1. Implicit, Explicit and Global Buttons for interlinking your
> textual information regardless of type or mode;
>
> 2. Org Mode Integration that reduces the complexity of dealing with
> Org constructs and lets you leverage Hyperbole in Org documents;
>
> 3. The Koutliner for rapid outlining with multi-level autonumbering
> (like legal numbering), per outline heading/cell permanent
> hyperlink anchors, and dynamic views that can be triggered by
> links themselves;
>
> 4. HyRolo for fast contact or any hierarchical record management
> including Org files or normal Emacs outlines;
>
> 5. HyControl for fast control over your Emacs windows and frames:
> interactively increase or decrease your your face sizes, adjust
> window sizes and layouts; replicate frame sizes and attributes
> precisely; show what you want where you want it.
>
> Whatever you like about Emacs you'll likely find similar in Hyperbole.
> Hyperbole grows with you as your knowledge and work complexity
> increases. An hour invested in Hyperbole has the potential to save
> you hundreds of hours in your future knowledge work. Come find out
> about the magic and why its not all hyperbole.
