Suyash Bire: Spin Your Own Spacemacs-lite

I will talk about my setup that uses evil-mode, general.el, which-key,
and use-package to emulate spacemacs-like behavior (in most cases). My
main focus will be on how general.el enables modularization. I will
show how I use this setup to code in python, write LaTeX documents,
and conduct reproducible research using org-mode
