On November 2nd, 2020, we had a series of lightning talks by members of the community.

### Raymond Puzio --- emacs hypernotebooks

Raymond presented his notebook software that uses Emacs to bring
together multiple programs to make a single set of computations. It's
able to pass data back and forth between these programs, generate
results, and even output publication-quality documents. Raymond
referenced a previous EmacsNYC talk Evan Misshula gave about
[reproducible
research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y). Raymond will
be publishing his code soon.


### Adrien Brochard -- emacs user survey 2020

Adrien spoke about his user survey, aimed at finding out how the
community uses Emacs. You can find more information and fill it out at
[https://emacssurvey.org/](https://emacssurvey.org/).

### Qiantan Hong -- crdt.el, a collaborative environment

Quintan spoke about crdt.el, a project which enables collaboration
through shared editing sessions. Check it out
[here](https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el). This project uses
algorithms from the Conflict-free Replicated Data Types family. A talk
about this can be viewed
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw)

### Qiantan Hong -- reflexive-music, an experimental music environment with Emacs as frontend

Quintan presented reflexive-music, an environment to create music
through code. He ended his presentation with a live concert. He was
inspired by Ivan Wyshnegradsky, a Russian composer known for his
microtonal compositions. Contact Quintan to encourage him to publish
his code!

### Zachary Kanfer -- Composing Electronic Music in Emacs

Zachary presented his solution to boredom during quarantine: his
software to compose looping music in Emacs. He had to dive into WAVE
files to create it. Find it at [https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zmusic](https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zmusic).
