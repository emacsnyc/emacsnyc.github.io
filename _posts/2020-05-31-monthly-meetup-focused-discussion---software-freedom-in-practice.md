title: Monthly Meetup&mdash;Focused Discussion - Software Freedom In Practice

We'll be meeting on https://meet.jit.si/EmacsNYC, a Free Software
video chat platform.

As a new experiment we're going to try a focused discussion and maybe
try again next month.

For this one we'd like to talk about Software Freedom in Practice,
we'll be using some content assistance coming from the EmacsConf 2019
and having a more focused discussion afterwards on what people have
done to accomplish their own software freedom and how they have sought
that out.

Please feel free to check out the video here by Greg Farough: GNU
Emacs as Software Freedom in Practice:

Also please join us on freenode on the #emacsnyc channel to ask
questions and keep the conversation going.
