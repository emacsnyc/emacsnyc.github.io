Josh Holbrook [github](https://github.com/jfhbrook) is a Staff Data Engineer at DoubleVerify and will be speaking about literate programming using org mode.

>Org mode, the task management and document markup system for Emacs, includes a tool called Babel which may be used for literate programming. In this talk I will explain literate programming, discuss how Org mode and Babel enable it, and go over an example using the slide deck itself. I will also cover some real-world experiences writing literate programs in Emacs and the pros and cons of doing so.
