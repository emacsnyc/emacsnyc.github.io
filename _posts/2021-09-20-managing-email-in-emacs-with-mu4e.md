A talk by Eric Collins

> Managing Email with mu4e and Other Software
>
> A talk by Eric Collins, Founder/Organizer of EmacsNYC and Senior
> Engineer/Engineering Manager at Parachute Health.
>
> You really enjoy doing everything in Emacs, editing text, managing all
> of your tasks, playing games like 2048, or building presentations, but
> do you read your email there? There are lots of options to choose
> from, but we'll focus on setting up mu4e for seamless indexing and
> reading. This will include setting up supporting software that makes
> this all work together seamlessly to process your email.
>
> Bringing email into familiar keybindings dramatically improves your
> ability to read and process messages. It's so helpful, you might just
> very well be able to achieve inbox zero.
