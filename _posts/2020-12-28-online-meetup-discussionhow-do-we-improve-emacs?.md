Emacs, relative to most software is old and has seen many
iterations. Recently there was a survey that was
[conducted](https://emacssurvey.org/2020) that helps us understand the
current state of the world for Emacs.

Let's talk about how we can take what we know from the past and what
we know now to help develop Emacs to a brighter future. This
conversation can go in any number of directions and we will see where
the conversation runs its course.
