During this discussion we'll be focusing on collaboration software and techniques. Living in this remote world and even before collaboration has been invaluable. Having a good setup can make a huge difference.

To help get us prepped for this a previous guest Qiantan Hong will be giving us a brief workshop on crdt.el, a project he debuted last year.

Join us and learn about a new Emacs specific way to collaborate and share with us your own techniques and woes.
