It's been one year since we've gone online and it's been seven years
since we started this meetup for you lambda enthusiasts.

In this discussion session, I think it'd be helpful to have a
retrospective on what has been going well and what could be
better. That said, we're thinking also about having some lightning
discussions about various topics. Ideas are welcome, if not we have
several to go from.
