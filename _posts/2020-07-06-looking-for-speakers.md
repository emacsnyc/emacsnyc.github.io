Due to an unforeseen pandemic, our group has moved to be online
only. This is a story all too familiar to so many previously in-person
gatherings.

This is not a new move. We've been doing remote meetups since March
and had some success, but know that this could be better. We know that
we don't need to keep things so local and we can support a community
for the rest of the world. This became even more apparent when we had
someone from India waking up at 6am to join us. So cool!

So with that we would like to make this attempt to expand to a larger
more inclusive community. This is our call for participants, whether
you wish to speak or participate in another way we would like to have
you.

I would encourage you to reach out directly and join us at our next
meetup. Your help and involvement can help us grow and make a more
vibrant and exciting community.

This is important to us and it is important that as our community does
grow that we maintain a safe and inclusive community that welcomes
people from all backgrounds. For those joining, please review our [code
of conduct](https://github.com/emacsnyc/meeting-logistics/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
