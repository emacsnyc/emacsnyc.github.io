We had some success with our focused discussions and we're going to try it again.

This time we're going to step outside of Emacs and delve into something adjacent, software privacy. We'll talk about best practices, what to look for, how to push back, and how to spread the word to others.

We'll be watching a TED talk from Finn LÃ¼tzow-Holm Myrstad(Norwegian Consumer Counsel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E_1AB1rsSw

Also please join us on freenode on the #emacsnyc channel to ask questions and keep the conversation going.
