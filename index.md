### We're the Emacs meetup in NYC!

We get together the first Monday of every month for Emacs related
activities. Fun times are had by all. =)

Longer talks are recorded with the consent of the speaker. We post the
videos on YouTube for streaming. We also release the [videos for
download] in a free format.

Announcements of new meetings and talk descriptions are posted on our
[meetup.com group]. We also cross-post them here on our blog, if you
prefer RSS and/or don't want to get a meetup.com account.

### Who's doing this?

We're [Eric] and [Zachary], a couple of developers and Emacs enthusiasts.
