This month we are doing lightning talks!

We look forward to any talk you want to give that is Emacs or Emacs adjacent.

We do want to hear everything you have to say, but we will be limiting
each talk to 10 minutes and we will be strict about this. If you have
more to say please consider talking to us about doing a longer talk
next month.

[Contact us](mailto:admin@emacsnyc.org) if you'd like to give a talk!

If you would like to give a lightning talk please feel free to come on
up and speak. We will have everything set up for you when you get
here.

If you would like to speak then or on any other occasion, take a look
at this [guide](/giving-a-talk.html).
